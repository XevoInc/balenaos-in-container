    subject: Add --no-tty option
    body: |-
      This enables running `docker run` without the `-ti` options, which allocates a pseudo-tty and keeps STDIN open.
      The motivation for this is to be able to spawn container from systemd, which provides no TTY.

    body: |-
      Stop mounting host's kernel modules as we want to minimize changes on the host
      and if there are kernel requirements they need to be satisfied before running
      resinOS in container.
      Replace the way to preload the volume with a `docker run` command. This removes
      the sudo dependency.
      Deactivate systemd watchdog in resinOS container

    subject: Allow running in detached mode, and passing additional arguments to docker
      run
    body: |-
      Running detached is useful if we don't want the script to block after the container is running.
      Having extra arguments allows, for instance, adding additional bind mounts, which may be useful for development or to add
      additional things like preloaded apps.
